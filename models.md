| Task | Commonly Used Models | Selected Model | Why This Model is Preferred | Computational Efficiency & Latency |
|------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Face Detection | Haar Cascades, MTCNN, RetinaFace, YOLO-Face | MediaPipe Face Detection | Highly stable, fast, and robust for frontal & semi-profile faces; minimal false negatives; no training required | Very lightweight (~2–3 MB), low latency (<10 ms/frame), optimized for real-time inference |
| Facial Landmark Detection | dlib 68 landmarks, OpenFace, FAN | MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks) | Provides dense facial landmarks enabling gaze, head pose, and mouth analysis from a single model | Single-pass inference, low FLOPs, efficient CPU execution, avoids multiple model calls |
| Gaze Estimation | CNN-based gaze models (MPIIGaze), iTracker | Landmark-based gaze (Face Mesh geometry) | No training data required; explainable geometric approach; sufficient accuracy for proctoring | Near-zero additional parameters; negligible latency increase |
| Head Pose Estimation | CNN pose regressors, Hopenet | SolvePnP + facial landmarks | Mathematical, interpretable, and robust; avoids heavy deep learning models | No learnable parameters; extremely low computation overhead |
| Mouth Activity Detection | Audio-based VAD, CNN lip-reading models | Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) | Lightweight and video-only; privacy-preserving; adequate for abnormal mouth activity detection | Simple geometric computation; negligible inference cost |
| Multiple Face / Person Detection | FaceNet, OpenPose | Face count (MediaPipe) + YOLO person class | Combines face-level and body-level cues for higher reliability | Reuses existing detections; no extra processing pipeline |
| Object Detection (External Objects) | SSD, Faster R-CNN, DETR | YOLOv8 (COCO-pretrained) | Strong performance on small objects (phone, book, laptop); real-time capable; widely adopted | Moderate parameter count (~3–11M), low inference latency, good FLOPs-to-accuracy tradeoff |
